## Description

This is my group project created at Launch Academy. Launch Academy is an intensive coding bootcamp for learning web development, focusing on the Ruby on Rails framework.

MonsterS is a lighthearted app for reviewing mythical monsters from movies and history. My group and I created authentication using Devise and, once logged in, a user can add a monster and review existing monsters. If a person is not logged in they can view, but not add or create, reviews. Logged in users can also upvote or downvote a review, which is done using Ajax to prevent a page refresh. On the homepage there is a Reactjs element which displays the latest monsters added to the site.
